# Youtube-Playlist-Duration
<h3>What it is about?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Oftentimes, when we want to study/learn something through YouTube, we might need to know how much time it will take to complete the course which is usually in the playlist.</li>
  <li>That's the very obvious thing to know since we need to schedule our time accordingly. I don't know why, but there's no option to view that on YouTube.</li>
  <li>So, this is when <i>Youtube-Playlist-Duration</i> becomes handy.</li>
  <li>This script can be used to find the duration of the playlist. Just pass the correct playlist ID as an argument.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can find the ID of the playlist in the URL when you visit that playlist. Everything that comes after "list=" is the ID of that playlist.</li>
</ul>
